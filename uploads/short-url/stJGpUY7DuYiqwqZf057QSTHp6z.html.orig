<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Organic phosphate sources include bones,
urine, excrement, plant matter, anything that once was living or came from a
living being.&nbsp; The earliest isolation of phosphorus was indeed from organic
phosphate sources and it was only later that phosphorus was obtained from
inorganic phosphates such as calcium phosphate.&nbsp; Organic phosphate sources
are of advantage due to their availability although the downside can be low
phosphate recovery and always when working with organic material, stench. </p>

phosphate is usually extracted by reaction with sulfuric acid followed
by
filtering.&nbsp; This is known as the wet method of producing phosphoric
acid.&nbsp; However after that point
the phosphate is removed enough from an organic source that I would
categorize it under one of the other headings.&nbsp; </p>

Polverone gives an excellent summary of the standard process of phosphorus
production using organic materials<sup><a href="#1">(1)</a></sup>:</p>

<td align="center">
<p align="justify">In the 1800s and earlier, phosphorus was prepared
by a number of processes. The earliest was that of Brandt, who
prepared it from human urine and charcoal. Later methods were
variations on the theme of "heat bone ash with charcoal at high
heat." The ashes of bones contain considerable phosphorus, combined
with calcium and oxygen, that can be reduced to the elemental state
with enough heat and a suitable reducing agent (carbon).<br>
<br>
I will summarize the method given in Muspratt:<br>
<br>
Animal bones are strongly heated in air until all organic matter has
been destroyed. The bones are powdered and to every 3 parts of
powder are added 2 parts concentrated sulfuric acid and 16 to 18
parts water. This causes some of the calcium in the bones to be
converted to calcium sulfate, which can then be removed by
decantation/filtration.<br>
<br>
The liquid thus obtained is evaporated to a thick, syrupy
consistency. It is mixed with one-fourth its weight of charcoal
powder, and then it is raised to near-red heat to make it perfectly
dry. The mass is transferred into a stoneware or iron retort in a
furnace. The retort has a copper tube connected to a heated
underwater receiver where the phosphorus can condense without
oxidation (and without solidifying and blocking the tube); the gases
that bubble to the surface are sent back to the chimney of the
furnace by a second, smaller copper tube. The furnace temperature is
gradually increased to white heat.<br>
<br>
First comes off steam, then hydrogen and carbon monoxide and
dioxide, and finally, at bright red heat, phosphorus begins to come
over, accompanied by phosphine and CO/CO2 (it is difficult to be
sure about some of the exact products because of the archaic and
sometimes inaccurate terms used in the text).<br>
<br>
Muspratt does not say precisely how long all of this takes, but
Wagner's Chemical Technology (1872) indicates that heat was
maintained for a long time, up to 48 hours.</p></td>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Although the emphasis of this section is on
different reducing agents for inorganic phosphates, the reducing agent is only
one half of the equation (I'm not using that term literally).&nbsp; The
phosphate is just as important as the reducing agent when it comes to making the

others.&nbsp; Still, in the spirit of categorizing things I am sorting these by
reducing agents used.&nbsp; And there are almost as many different reducing
agents as there are phosphates that people have tried.&nbsp; Please just keep in
mind however that one phosphate cannot be swapped directly for another, the
reaction might not work at all or it might go much too fast (think

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Carbon is one of the most time
tested reducing agents of phosphates.&nbsp; The original alchemical
preparation relying on urine and other detritus succeeded in making
phosphorous due to all of the organic material present which broke
down to the carbon needed to carry out the reduction. On the whole
carbon reduction requires more intense and sustained heat than other
methods of phosphorus production although carbon has the advantage
of being as widely available as phosphates themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

silicon dioxide, and tricalcium phosphate (the standard phosphate
ore) at temperatures of up to 1500°C in an arc furnace<sup><a href="#1">(1)</a></sup>
is still the standard method to prepare phosphorous.&nbsp; Although
the problem posed to the at home chemist with this operation is
great and succinctly addressed in this quote from Polverone<sup><a href="#1">(1)</a></sup>
"Building a suitably airtight, nonconducting, refractory vessel for
an arc furnace is something well beyond my current engineering
skills/resources..."&nbsp; The reactions occurring in this method of
preparation can be shown as:</p>

<p align="justify">I used a mixture of KH2PO4 and homemade willow
charcoal with no sand. The retort was made by 'encapsulating' a 10
ml lab glass vial with 'fire' cement and cooking this in the kitchen
oven at 250 C for 1 h. The spout was a piece of copper tubing sealed
on the retort with the same fire cement, (this comes as a ready-made
putty in my local hardware store). The furnace design is very simple
indeed: I have made a refractory kiln with a blowing pipe attached
to a 'cold-shot' powerful hair-drier. The furnace was fired with BBQ
charcoal. I have successfully melted iron in this, so I guess the
temperature at full regime, must have been in excess of 1300 C (it
looked so bright it would hurt my eyes to stare at it).<br>
I have tried with thicker glass jars, without success. I guess the
glass, which replaces the silica, melts inside the fire cement
'mold' and acts as a flux aiding the melting of the phosphate. The
usual reduction reaction then occurs. It took 30 min or so at bright
white heat for the first spontaneously flammable bubbles to break
the surface of the water in the condenser. They produced
white-bright little flames, so I guess some phosphorus got lost in
that way. I am now thinking of repeating the experiment with ground
glass powder in a slightly bigger retort.<br>
I still have my pellet of P4 in a small jar or water. It now sits
proudly on my desk.<br>
<br>
Remember to keep the retort size as SMALL as possible so that it
will be easier to achieve and sustain internal high temperatures,
and do NOT use metal retorts. Too much heat is simply transferred
away to the spout and then to the water in the condenser. <br>
Do not use gas torches unless you have an acetylene/oxygen source.
Go for a nice charcoal/air furnace which you can make with an old
bucket and refractory mix (and a nice hair-drier from your
mum/girlfriend/granny...)”&nbsp;</p></td>

used metal retorts for this process the point made above is valid,
unless the whole retort is placed inside of a kiln or the like it
does do well to conduct heat away and the heat from a torch is
feeble at best to get the reaction going.&nbsp; The following quote

<p align="justify">I have, a couple of times, tried straightforward
phosphate reduction with charcoal and heat. The vessel is a steel
pipe with a screwed-on cap at one end and a screwed-on nipple at the
other. The nipple has a section of copper pipe inserted in it and
sealed with furnace cement. I filled the pipe with a mixture of
diammonium phosphate and charcoal on the (admittedly dubious)
premise that the ammonium salt would have a lower decomposition
temperature and might help the reaction along. Plus it was the only
pure phosphate I could find on short notice.<br>
<br>
I heated the apparatus with a large gas laboratory burner and had a
vessel of warm water to dip the copper pipe into. On my first
attempt, I got a lot of strange/unpleasant smelling gases and water
condensation at first (I wasn't going to submerge the tube until I
was sure something interesting would come out). I also saw some gas
leakage around the threads on the pipe. When it looked like the
reaction wasn't going anywhere, I removed the nipple/copper tube
assembly. I then heated the tube some more just for curiosity's
sake. Toward the end I started to see something interesting. The
mixture was melting and bubbling out of the tube a bit. I could heat
this portion directly with the gas burner, and when I got it red hot
I started to see a rather distinctive flame come out of voids in the
material. It looked like the flames I'd gotten by igniting red
phosphorus (obtained from match box strike strips) and it had the
same smell.<br>
<br>
After that minor encouragement I figured I'd clean things out and
try again, more patiently this time. However, it turns out that
whatever hot diammonium phosphate and charcoal turn into, it is
hard, insoluble, and tenacious. I had to painstakingly chip/smash
slag out of the pipe with a metal rod.<br>
<br>
On my second attempt, much later, I kept the copper tube underwater
the whole time and tried to be patient with the heating. The gas
burner took a while (15 minutes?) to heat the tube up to red heat,
and even then could maintain that heat only where the tube directly
contacted the flame. It never got hotter than a medium-red. There
was a considerable amount of junk deposited in the water - mostly
copper salts created by hot/moist exit gases - but no phosphorus
that I could see.</p></td>

<p class="MsoNormal">As mentioned previously, the selection of
phosphate is just as important as the selection of reducing agent.&nbsp;
Supposedly phosphorite can be reduced with carbon at 500 to 600°C<sup><a href="#59">(59)</a></sup>,
Strepta performed experiments using aluminum phosphate which has a
lower temperature necessary for reduction, 1100°C according to the
literature<sup><a href="#6">(6)</a></sup>.&nbsp; Strepta's apparatus
consisted of a quartz tube heated by ni-chrome wire with a helium
sweep though it was later suggested that his helium, being balloon
grade, contained sufficient oxygen to decimate his yield<sup><a href="#7">(7)</a></sup>.&nbsp;
Although a portion of the thread describing the experiment is quoted
below<sup><a href="#8">(8)</a></sup> I highly recommend reading
Strepta's detailed experimental description complete with photos to
which the figures listed below point to:</p>

<td align="center">
<p align="justify">The reaction to be tried was: 2AlPO4 + C ==&gt;
2Al2O3 + CO2 + 2P. The authors used equal weights of AlPO4 and C
although this results in a large excess of C by stoichiometry,
possibly to ensure that all of the AlPO4 is reduced.<br>
<br>
I added 4.5 g of dried AlPO4 to 4.5 g of carbon black and mixed this
in a coffee grinder for two minutes. I was only able to get 4.7 g
(of the 9g total) of this mix into the reaction tube as I wanted it
no more than half full. More could have been added by reducing the
headspace above the mix and/or by tightly packing the mix. <br>
<br>
4.7 g of reactants would represent .6g available P at 100% yield.
With a yield of 70% this amount would be reduced to about .4g.<br>
<br>
<strong>Experimental</strong><br>
<br>
When finally assembled and ready, I started the gas flow and let it
run about 10 minutes before ramping the temperature to 650 C. After
allowing the initial transient to settle, I continued to ramp the
temperature in 100 deg increments every 5 minutes. As the temp
transitioned from 1050 to 1150 C, the exit portion of the tube
darkened and the exhaust gas bubbles burst into flame as they
surfaced in the beaker. I continued the temp ramp to 1250 C. After a
few minutes at this temp, the probe readings (monitored at the 595
output) became erratic, dropping to as low as 600 and to as high as
1400. I suspected a poor connection in the circuitry or a failure of
the 595. After a few minutes, I shut the power off to the controller
but left the gas flowing and allowed the tube to cool. As it cooled
the readings became steady again and at 250 C I removed the
insulation and quartz tube from the galvanized pipe section and
unwrapped the kaowool. As I unwrapped the tube it broke into two
pieces. (Fig 7) The area under the heating element was extensively
cracked, and through handling, another section broke off. I removed
the tc probe and found that the Ni-Chrome sheathing had melted and
the melt had largely gathered into three globules. One of these had
a vitreous solid adhering to it –this appeared to be a piece of
melted quartz. <br>
<br>
Some phosphorus was evident in the exit section of the tube (Fig 9)
but this was not recovered. About 2.7 g of the original 4.7 g of
reactants was recovered (Fig 8) and this had not fused but was still
a loose powder as described in the article.<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
<br>
It appears that AlPO4 is reduced by carbon in the vicinity of
1100-1150 C as described, although I was not able to confirm the %
released (claimed as 72-83% after 1 hr) as the apparatus itself was
also reduced to junk. It also appears that a carbon reaction,
presumably with O2, is responsible for the extreme temperature
excursion experienced. </p></td>

<p align="justify">Improved method of extracting- Phosphorus from
Bones.</p><p align="justify">—LeGenie Industrial describes a process
recently patented by II. Cari Mantrand, of Paris, for extracting
phosphorus from bones more economically than by the processes
heretofore employed. The calcined bones, reduced to a fine powder,
are mingled with a sufficient quantity of pulverized charcoal to
combine, as carbonic oxide, with all the oxygen of the phosphate.
The mixture is placed in an earthenware cylinder varnished on the
inside, filling the cylinder to three-fourths of its capacity. The
cylinder is then heated red hot, and a current of hydrochloric acid
gas is blown into it. The phosphate of lime is immediately
decomposed, forming chloride of calcium and carbonic oxide, while
the liberated phosphorus is evaporated and driven through a copper
tube, which leads into a vessel of cold water, where the phosphorus
is condensed. The chloride of calcium, disembarrassed of the
charcoal, in contact with sulphuric acid, regenerates hydrochloric
acid for a new operation. The labour of pulverizing the bones may be
saved by digesting them with a solution of hydrochloric acid; using
for this purpose the water of the condenser from the preceding
operation.</p></td>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The allure of using aluminum
for the reaction of phosphates is two fold.&nbsp; First off, the
reaction is exothermic.&nbsp; Initially it was thought through
thermodynamic calculations that the reaction would be
self-sustaining although that seems not to be the case as it has not
been ignited by a thermite boost<sup><a href="#23">(23)</a></sup>,
still it does overall decrease the energy burden that needs to be
supplied.&nbsp; Secondly the reaction imitates at a lower
temperature.&nbsp; These two boons look great on paper but the
temperatures involves still lie on the extreme end of home chemistry
and the engineering hurdles are still nearly as significant as they
are for the production of phosphorous from the reaction of
phosphates using carbon.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The form of the aluminum has
been simultaneously cited as unimportant (due to it being a liquid
at reaction temperature) to critical, various sources of aluminum
from aluminum cans to german pyro dark have been cited as being used
for these reactions.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In theory each of these
reaction involving aluminum could instead use magnesium.&nbsp;
Magnesium should give higher reaction temperatures (leading to
self-sustaining reaction) and possibly a lower initialization
temperature however work using magnesium has been limited.&nbsp; One
example is cited in the section on organic phosphates above<sup><a href="#3">(3)</a></sup>
where the demonstration reduces bone ash to elemental phosphorous
using magnesium powder.&nbsp; One possible complication however is
that formulations often include silicon dioxide to displace a
portion of the phosphorous and under reaction conditions the
magnesium reacting with the silicon dioxide to give magnesium oxide
and elemental silicon is a real possibility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Still, all told aluminotheric
reduction of phosphate are the only reactions to yield significant
and reproducible amounts of phosphorous.&nbsp; Additionally
throughout the bulk of the thread these reactions also take
advantage of a specific phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate.&nbsp;
This material is available over the counter for water softening
purposes and contains a high percentage of phosphorous coupled with
a low melting point of ca. 550°C<sup><a href="#9">(9)</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In a reference<sup><a href="#10">(10)</a></sup>

<p align="justify">Action of Aluminium on Phosphorus
Compounds—Phosphorus vapour when led over powdered aluminium, heated
to a dull red beat in a current of hydrogen, combines with it with
incandescence, forming a dark greyish-black unfused mass, which is
decomposed in contact with moist (normal) air, forming PH3, and
leaving a greyish-white powder. It is decomposed also by water,
aluminium also by water, aluminium hydroxide and a brownish-black
residue being left ; and by acids and alkalis, which dissolve it
almost completely with evolution of PH3. The compound remains
unaltered when heated in air.<br>
<br>
At more or less elevated temperatures, all phosphoric, acid
compounds (meta-, pyro-, and ortho-salts alike) are decomposed by
aluminium. Metaphosphates, however, undergo the most complete
change, according to the equation—<br>
<br>
6NaPO3 + 15Al = 6NaAl02 + 2Al2O3 + Al5P3 + P3<br>
<br>
The addition of silica effects the release of the remaining
phosphorus, thus :—<br>
<br>
6NaPO3 + 10Al + 3SiO2 = 3Na2SiO3 + 5Al2O3 + 3P2<br>
<br>
Calcium and magnesium salts are as efficacious as those of sodium,
but the superphosphates of commerce are not available for the
production of phosphorus in this manner. If, however, bone ash be
decomposed by hydrochloric acid instead of by sulphuric acid, a
material suitable for the purpose is obtained.<br>
<br>
Hence phosphorus may be produced, with almost quantitative
completeness of yield, at relatively low temperatures...</p></td>

"NaPO3 produced by melting NH4NaHPO4 is mixed with Al powder and
heated. Already at red heat, the mass begins to glow and emit P
vapors. Other phosphate salts can also be used, even the Ca and Mg
salts."&nbsp; Yet another reference<sup><a href="#12">(12)</a></sup>

<p align="justify">The applications of aluminum in the arts multiply
with much the same rapidity as do those of electricity. The <em>
Berichte</em> describes a new method of preparing phosphorus by its
use as a reducing agent. The process is so simple that it can easily
be illustrated on the lecture table. Hydrogen ammonium sodium
phosphate is fused in a porcelain crucible until it is changed into
sodium metaphosphate; aluminum turnings are then dropped into the
liquid, and the freed phosphorus bursts into flame. Now, if the
experiment is tried with a glass tube, instead of a crucible, a slow
current of hydrogen being passed over the mixture of the salt and
aluminum, the phosphorus distills into the cooler part of the tube
without the formation of any phosphoretted hydrogen. The residue
consists of alumina, sodium aluminate, and a phosphide of alumina -
Al<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<br>
By these steps in the process only 30 per cent of the phosphorus in
the mineral used can be obtained; but the phosphide is decomposed
entirely by heating it with silica, and this may be added at the
beginning of the experiment and the reaction proceeds without
difficulty and without loss.<br>
<br>
It is advised that for the lecture table a combustion tube a yard
long be used; two and a half parts of aluminum, six parts of sodium
metaphosphate (obtained from heating previously the hydrogen
ammonium sodium phosphate) and two parts of finely pulverized silica
are placed in the tube, a slow current of hydrogen is passed
through, and heat is applied until the reaction begins. This is
shown by sudden incandescence, and phosphorus is seen to condense in
globules on the cooler part of the tube, at the end where hydrogen
escapes.<br>
<br>
Instead of this phosphate, any ordinary phosphate may be used, but
experimenters are warned not to use the superphosphates containing
calcium sulphate mixed with them, such as are used for fertilizing
purposes, because the sulphate is suddenly decomposed by the
aluminum with an explosion when a certain temperature is reached.</p></td>

fumed silica, diatomite, kieselguhr<sup><a href="#19">(19)</a></sup>

considered one of the hurdles to overcome to get good yields with
this reaction and usually necessitates prolonged heating and also
deters the reaction from being self-sustaining.&nbsp; However boron
trioxide may work in place of silica.&nbsp; The advantage being a
much lower melting point<sup><a href="#14">(14)</a></sup>.&nbsp; If

6NaPO3 + 10AI + 3B2O3 = 6NaBO2 + 5Al203 + 3P2 and had better yield
in terms of less solid residue (ash) after the reaction.<br>
<br>
Stoichiometry of the above equation calls for a ratio of calgon/Al/silica
of 2.93/1.29/1. I mixed it accordingly and ground it thoroughly in a
mortar. The B2O3 is quite hard after it cools and a bit of work is
required to pulverize it. The end result is a mix which acts as a
fluid, rocking back and forth if swayed and spurting to the top of
the tube if the bottom is rapped sharply on a hard surface. Again I
took 3 grams of this mix and heated it at the bottom of a pyrex test
tube, the other end of which was wrapped with a damp piece of paper
towel. CO2 was used a a protective atmosphere and the exhaust was
routed through a half full 100 ml cylinder of H2O.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heating of the tt was via a meker burner. The first noticeable
difference in using B2O3 was that the edges of the mix began to
shrink and curl before the reaction started, a result of the B2O3
starting to flow.<br>
<br>
Once initiated the reaction was, again, self-sustaining, but
noticeably slower -12 to 15 seconds- than the 3-4 seconds previously
observed with silica.<br>
<br>
Yield of P was .265 g from .512 available (identical result from 2
tries). The ash, however, was smaller and almost identical mass in
both tries. The residual was .500 g less the initial mass (2.500 vs
3.000). If all the difference is attributed to released P, the
efficiency of the reaction is ~98%. the missing 50% P could possibly
be lost as P2O5 (quite a bit of gas escapes from the 100 ml cyl.

as such if it reaches the outlet it will plug the outlet.&nbsp;
Making sure the reactants are dry also reduces lost yield to
phosphine.&nbsp; It is also noted that phosphorous comes over last
and that the best yields are obtained on prolonged heating.&nbsp;
Another discovery in the thread was that adding a small amount (6-7
wt%) of sodium chloride to the reaction mixture may help 'cut the
reaction time in half'<sup><a href="#20">(20)</a></sup>.&nbsp; This
was postulated to be caused by lowering the viscosity of the melt

6NaPO3 + 10Al + 3SiO2 --&gt; 3Na2SiO3 + 5Al2O3 + 6P<br>

Stoichiometric ratios of the reactants were mixed in a mortar. The
Al was 100-200 mesh, the SiO2 200 mesh pottery grade, and the NaPO3

<br>
I have been wanting to try this for some time but have not been able
to find a suitable luting compound to join a ceramic retort to a
glass adaptor. I finally settled upon the best candidate that would
give me a truly positive seal, yet was releasable following the
experiment. This is Permatex high temperature RTV silicone. Previous
testing with a ceramic tile/glass slide showed that an RTV seal can
be destroyed in about 2 hours with con sulfuric acid at 125C,
thereby allowing recovery of the glass piece.<br>
<br>
After loading the retort the 24/40 glass adapter was attached using
the RTV and allowed to cure overnight. Today the retort was
backfilled with argon, placed in a tube furnace, and a 400 mL beaker
of water located to provide a water seal for the adaptor outlet.<br>
<br>
Over a period of 3 hours the temperature of the furnace was brought
up to a maximum of 1300C. Most of the time there was just a periodic
large bubble evolved indicating expansion of the gas in the retort.
However, at times the bubbling would stop, be erratic, or even form
a vacuum of about 1/2" water. During the last 100C or so it seemed
like no gas was formed, or any vacuum either.<br>
<br>
P never did drop into the receiver as I had intended. When I removed
the insulation from the adaptor I found a small pool of solidified
P, tainted red from the RTV. Using a bunsen burner I melted the P,
picked up the furnace and drained the 4 or 5 drops of waxy, heavy P
into the receiver.</p></td>

(the part of the apparatus in the furnace was glowing reddish
orange. The only difference from the apparatus I used than the one
shown in that thread was that instead of bubbling the exit gasses
through a tin can soldered on, which I tried but wouldn't hold
water, I put another 90 deg elbow on the end of the pipe and a short
section pointing upwards, this part was filled with water. <br>

As the thing was heated, phosphine (so I think) started coming out
of the end as a white mist, so I burned it off with my propane

After this, the water started getting milky, so I figured there was
some phosphorus in there, but at the very end of the run, I heated
the water up until it boiled, and then dumped what I supposed would
be a water/phosphorus mix into a tin can filled with water. All that
came out was water. Since the furnace ate a handful of wood or two
every few minutes, I had to stoke the fire a LOT, and the only way
to add more fuel was to take off the lid, set it down on some
bricks, add more fuel, and then put the lid back on. Every time I
did this some of the water spilled out. I don't think phosphorus is

tube is fitted and acts as insulation. The temperature in the tube
is monitored with a Fluke P 80 inconel immersion type probe embedded
in the Pb3(PO4)2 and connected to an ExTech temp meter. The input
and output ends of the tube are fitted with natural cork stoppers
which stand up to the heat far better than rubber. The cork to glass
tube joint is sealed with silicon rubber. To further ensure that the
system remains sealed, the ouput tube is run into a beaker of water
and produces visible/audible bubbles when everything is working
correctly.<br>
<br>
The tube is charged with Pb3(PO4)2 also made according to Rupp

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The hydrogen is generated by
electrolysis using sulfuric acid-water at battery acid
concentration, ie, sg =1.275. The anode and cathode are both made
from sheet lead (from Home Depot). The cathode is a 3 inch high
section spiraled inward for max surface area. A 3 inch wide funnel
is mounted over the cathode to capture the H2 and funnel it into a
10 in. long tube which is terminated with a rubber stopper. A glass
tube carries the hydrogen out and another hole in the stopper
permits a piece of #10 Cu wire to complete the circuit to the
cathode. The anode is also sheet Pb and sits immediately above the
cathode. <br>

The 10 inch collection tube permits the generator to produce a
sufficient “pressure head” to bubble the H2 through the subsequent
H2SO4 and CaSO4 dryer sections. <br>
<br>
The container is a tall glass flower vase. When operated (typically
@ 6 amps) for an hour, the solution becomes too hot to handle. It
also progressively darkens as it produces the brown precipitate,
PbO2, as can be seen in the sequence of photos. A strong odor of
ozone is apparent during operation.</p>

The hydrogen generator (6.6 amp) is started and run for about 10
minutes before the heating coil is energized. Heating is begun
slowly, keeping the temperature below 400C for the first hour. You

it's a much less vigorous reducer than Al and so the reaction can't

that metaphosphoric acid or metaphosphates will liberate phosphorus

I have verified without recovery (like the aluminum sheet

phosphorus from hot fused metaphosphates. Even lead will do it. I
think the critical point in going from demonstration to production
isn't going to be the reducing power of the metal (within reason),
